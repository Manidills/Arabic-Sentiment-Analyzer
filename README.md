# Arabic-Sentiment-Analyzer

The dataset can be downloaded from Ashraf Elnagar's GitHub repository (https://github.com/elnagara/HARD-Arabic-Dataset).


More specifically, we will build a model that classifies Arabic hotel reviews as either positive or negative.Each entry in the dataset includes a review in Arabic and a rating between 1 and 5. We will convert this to a binary classification dataset by assigning reviews with a rating of above 3 a positive label of 1 and assigning reviews with a rating of less than 3 a negative label of 0.
